# streamlit_webapp_template

This is a template to be used with PyCharm and venv in order to create a streamlit webapp.

Instructions:

1. Click "Use this template" to create a repository for your app.
2. Clone your new repository in PyCharm, so as to have it locally in your machine.
3. Mark "src" as the root directory of the project.
4. Add a new (local) Python interpreter.
5. Run "scripts/make_env.sh": this will create a new environment and install the requirements.

You are done: simply run "src/main.py" to launch the app! (The actual code for the app is in "src/app.py".)
