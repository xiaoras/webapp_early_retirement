# webapp_early_retirement

This is a streamlit webapp to compute and visualize early retirement options.

Currently, it works locally in PycCharm and venv. To launch it:

1. Clone the repository in PyCharm, so as to have it locally in your machine.
2. Mark "src" as the root directory of the project.
3. Add a new (local) Python interpreter.
4. Run "scripts/make_env.sh": this will create a new environment and install the requirements.
5. You are done: simply run "src/main.py" to launch the app!
